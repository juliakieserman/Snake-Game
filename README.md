The game begins when a user clicks enter. There are 4 levels. The level is automatically transitioned to the next when a specific score has been reached. The second level creates a new barrier for every other fruit eaten, the third level creates a new barrier for every fruit eaten, and the fourth level increases the speed of the snake. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall, a barrier, or itself. When it does, a pop-up box displayed the final score and gives the user an OK button to click. This button automatically closes the window.
